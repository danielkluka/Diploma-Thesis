## Assignment
### Objectives which should be achieved:
The aim of this thesis is to design and implement a robust data transmission system in an NB-IoT environment with the resilience against cyber threats. The work will focus on designing a hardware and software platform for the secure transmission of data using NB-IoT technology.

The thesis will include the design of a secure communication solution based on NB-IoT technology, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of transmitted data. Emphasis will be placed on implementing security measures, for example, in the Node-RED platform, which will be used for device management and data processing. The work will also cover the design and implementation of security for the selected broker and the use of TLS for encrypting communication.

Additionally, a hardware solution will be designed to integrate selected sensors and enable data collection and transmission. The measured values, including diagnostic data about the transmission, will subsequently be stored in a suitable database, with clear visualization provided. The thesis will also include a comprehensive analysis of the security levels of individual components, describing potential vulnerabilities. The communication efficiency within the NB-IoT network will also be evaluated, including an analysis of the energy consumption during operation.

The output of the diploma thesis will be a functional device and an assessment of its resilience to security threats in the NB-IoT environment.
